														Frog hops problem

Kermit, a frog hops in a particular way such that:

1. He hops 20cm in the first hop, 10cm in the second hop and 5cm in the third hop.
2. After three hops Kermit rests for a while and then again follows the same hopping pattern.

Calculate the total distance travelled by Kermit (in centimeters) for the provided number of hops. 
Exactly 4 numbers of hops will be provided to the program (one number per line) as per the below example.

Suppose the following number of hops is provided to the program:

4
6
3
5

Then the total distance covered should be displayed as follows:

55
70
35
65
